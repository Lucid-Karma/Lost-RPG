- Greetings, stranger. Do you require assistance on your journey?
*   [Greetings! I'm actually here on a quest, and I'm seeking some guidance.]
    Ah, a quest, you say? What kind of guidance do you seek?
    * *     [I've recently met the princess by the sea, and now I'm headed to the Dragon Village. Can you help me with directions?]
            Ah, the princess by the sea... She's made quite an impression. To reach the Dragon Village, you'll need to cross the bridge beyond the village. Follow the path through the forestâ€”it will lead you to the heart of the village.
