- Well met, traveler. What brings you to our humble village today?
*   [Greetings! I've been tasked with investigating the tensions between kingdoms.]
    Ah, the tensions, yes. They've caused quite a stir. The Dragon Village folks claim we've taken something valuable from them. I'm not so sure about that, but who am I to say?
    * *     [Do you have any insight into what this contested item might be?]
            Some say it could be an ancient artifact, but it's all speculation at this point.
            * * *   [Interesting. I'll have to investigate further. By the way, have you     heard anything about the princess?]
                    Aye, I've heard whispers. She's often found on the eastern cliffs, lost in thought.
                    * * * * [Can you provide any guidance on how to approach her?]
                            She seems to appreciate solitude by the sea. Maybe engage her with something personal or reflective.
                            * * * * *   [I'll keep that in mind. Thank you for your              insights.] <>
                    * * * * [Is there anything else you can share about her visits to the     cliffs?]
                            I don't know. She doesn't look very happy.
                            * * * * *   [Thank you for your assistance. Farewell.] <>
    * *     [How has this dispute affected the day-to-day life in the village?]
	    There isn't much to say. We are just restless.
	    * * *    [I can understand. Thank you for your assistance. Farewell.] <> 
*   [Hello! I'm a seeker of stories and adventure. What tales do you have to share about this village?]
	Ah, seeking stories, are you? Well, let me regale you with a tale or two from our village's past.
	* *     [I'm all ears! Share your tales with me.] 
        	Gather 'round then, for I have stories of heroism, secrets, and the heart of our village.
        	* * *   [Your stories are captivating. By the way, have you heard about the      princess seeking insight by the sea?]
        	        Aye, I've heard the murmurings. She seeks solace on the cliffs to the east, overlooking the waves.
        	        * * * * [Thank you for your assistance. Farewell.] <>
	* *	[I appreciate that, but before that, could you shed some light on the current situation with the Dragon Village?]
	  	I can't do this, sorry. I do not know anything.
	  	* * *   [I understand. Thank you for everything.] <>
- Take care. May our kingdoms find common ground soon.
