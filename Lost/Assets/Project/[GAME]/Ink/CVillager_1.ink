- Welcome, traveler. Haven't seen your face around here before. Are you passing through or on a quest?
*   [Greetings! I've been sent to investigate the tension between kingdoms.]
    - -     Ah, the dispute, yes. The Dragon Village folks are convinced we've taken something of theirs. I can't say I agree, but that's just me. 
    * *     [Do you have any idea what this contested item might be?]
            I've heard whispers that it might be an ancient relic, but who knows for sure?
            * * *   [Interesting. By the way, have you heard anything about the princess seeking insight by the sea?]
                    Aye, I've heard talk. She's always been a contemplative one, that princess.
                    * * * *     [Do you know where she usually goes by the sea?]
                                She tends to favor a spot on the cliffs to the east. A splendid view, it is.
                                * * * * *   [Thank you for the information. I appreciate         your help.] <>
                    * * * *     [Any advice on how I might be able to assist her?]
                                If you wish to aid her, perhaps a heartfelt conversation is all she needs. But be genuine, she's got a keen sense for sincerity.

    * *     [What's your personal opinion on the situation between the kingdoms?]
	        If this problem is not solved, bad days are coming soon. That's all I can say. <>
*   [Hello! I'm a traveler seeking stories and adventure. What tales do you have to share?]
	- -     Well, traveler, I've got a tale or two to share. They might lighten your spirits.
	* *     [I'd love to hear your stories.] 
        	Gather 'round then, for I've got tales of daring adventures and lost treasures.
        	* * *   [Your stories are captivating. By the way, have you heard about       the princess seeking insight by the sea?]
        	        Aye, I've heard the whispers. She's got a heart as deep as the ocean, that one.
        	        * * * *     [Do you know where she usually goes by the sea?]
        	                    She's often seen on the cliffs to the east, gazing at the waves. Lovely view, it is.

        	                     * * * * *  [I'll remember that advice. Thank you.] <>
	* *	[I appreciate that. But before, could you tell me about the current tensions between the kingdoms?]
    	If this problem is not solved, bad days are coming soon. That's all I can say. <>
- Farewell. May our kingdoms find peace soon.
